# Space Adventure

## Requirements
* IDE with MinGW 7.3 32-bit compiler or newer ( I used JetBrain's CLion )

For other compilers you have to use diffrent [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) version
## How to run the game
* Copy "Zawartosc" directory and files from "SFML-2.5.1\bin" to folder which contains your .exe file.
* Enjoy the game :)

## Future development 
* Multiplayer
* Player against computer mode

*UPDATE 02.04.2019 Game doesnt work because of the changes applied to SFML 2.5+versions, issue may be fixed some day...
