Space Adventure

To run the game you have to 
Install mingw version 7.3 32bit, for other compilers you can switch SFML library.
Copy "Zawartosc" folder and files from "SFML-2.5.1\bin" to folder which contains your .exe file.
Enjoy the game :)

*UPDATE 02.04.2019* Game doesnt work because of the changes applied to SFML 2.5+version, issue will be fixed ASAP.
