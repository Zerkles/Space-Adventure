Space Adventure

To run the game you have to 
	1.Install mingw version 7.3 or newer 32-bit version, for other compilers you can switch SFML library.
	2.Copy "Zawartosc" folder and files from "SFML-2.5.1\bin" to folder which contains your .exe file.
	3.Enjoy the game :)

Multiplayer doesnt work, may be fixed some day...

*UPDATE 02.04.2019* Game doesnt work because of the changes applied to SFML 2.5+versions, issue will be fixed ASAP.
